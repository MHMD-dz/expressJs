# Express Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all my express practice codes.

I am learning express from YouTube tutorials and pushing every section I watch as a commit, so this repo represents my learning progress step by step.

## 📌 Purpose
- Practice express basics
- Understand concepts by coding
- Track my progress through commits

## 🛠 Tools
- Language: JS
- FrameWork: express
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- OS: Kali Linux

## 📂 Structure
Each commit = one Section from the tutorial

Examples:
- sessionn
- auth
- DB
- request methods

## ⚠️ Note
This code is for learning purposes only, not production ready.

Feel free to explore the commits history to see my evolution.
